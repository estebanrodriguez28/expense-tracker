# ExpenseTracker

ExpenseTracker is an android app designed to organize expenses. The app was built using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Android Studio. The app establishes a local database with the Room library to store expenses a user enters and utilizes asynchronous programming techniques such as Coroutines and Flows to handle database operations. Expenses can be edited, deleted, and sorted in the app.
